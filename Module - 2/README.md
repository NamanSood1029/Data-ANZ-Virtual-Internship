# **Overview**

Module 2 consists of feature tuning, importance and machine learning modeling to predict future salaries.

## Goal

Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data (e.g. age) or those that you construct or derive yourself (e.g. those relating to purchasing behavior). Visualize any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.

Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above

For a challenge: build a decision-tree based model to predict salary. Does it perform better? How would you accurately test the performance of this model?
